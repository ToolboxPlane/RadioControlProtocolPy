# RadioControlProtocolPy
Implementation of ToolboxPlane/RadioControlProtocol in Python 3

## How to use
Run the setup.py script to compile the library:
```bash
python3 setup.py build
```
This will create a shared library file in the `build` directory.

You can either install this by running
```bash
python3 setup.py install
```
or use it without installing by having the `.so` file in your working
directory.
